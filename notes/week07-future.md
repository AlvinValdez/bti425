## BTI425 Week 7 Notes

Recall, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

Since Week 6 was spent with a quick introduction of the angular workflow (ie, bootstrapping an Angular app using "ng new", running the app with "ng serve" editing classes using typescript, etc), we can now focus our attention specifically on **components**, and how we can construct a view in Angular using components.

Once we are comfortable working with components, we can continue progressing through Angular in the following weeks.  This will include topics such as, routing, services, and forms.

**Test 3 is on Tuesday, March 6**

The test questions are based on the Angular topics and learning experience, during last week *and* this week. That includes some content from the current assignment too.

**Topics:**

The first two documents are repeated from the Week 6 coverage:

[Angular Components Introduction](angular-components-intro): This document discusses Components in detail, including how to get started using components / creating components from scratch, using "templates" in components, and writing attribute/structural directives.

[Angular Components Example](angular-components-example): This document guides us through a simple example ("animals"), where we plan a view with multiple components from scratch.

The next documents are new this week:

[Angular Components Continued](angular-components-more): This document contains the important review topics for Angular Components including:
* Creating Components Using the Angular CLI
* Structure of an Angular Component
* Component / Template Data Binding
* Lifecycle Methods
* Component Interaction
* Angular Directives (Structural / Attribute)

[Angular date pipe](angular-date-pipe)  
Describes how to use a built-in Angular feature to format dates on a view.
