## BTI425 Week 8 Notes

On Monday, we have Test 2. Then, in the other day's computer-lab session, we will cover a few more routing topics, and can begin work on Assignment 2. 

<br>

### Test info

Test 2 is on Monday, March 4, 2019. 

Please review the [information about tests](https://bti425.ca/notes/week04#test-info) from awhile ago. 

You can expect test questions about topics covered since the last test, all the way to a small amount of questions about this week's forward-looking topics. Obviously, you must review the topics yourself, but in general, you can expect questions about:
* React components, sequential and contained 
* React routing 
* React and working with a web service 
* React and forms 
* React deployment 
* Angular platform overview
* Angular components
* Angular routing 
* Angular simple service, and working with a web service
