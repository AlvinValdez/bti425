## Routing in Angular, an introduction

This is a very brief and simple introduction to *routing* in an Angular app. In a week or two, we will provide more coverage. 

Recently, you learned about, and implemented routing in a React app. The topic idea is the same in an Angular app - to enable navigation among components, and/or component replacement in a viewport. The implementation is similar enough for you to learn and use within minutes.

### Prerequisites, what we need

We need an app that was generated with the ``--routing`` option, which (among other tasks) creates a source code file `app-routing.module.ts` (and inside is a class named `AppRoutingModule`). The generation task does a few other useful things too, which we'll get to in a moment.

We also need a few other things, which should be obvious:
* multiple components (for navigation/replacement)
* a nav menu (or other workflow control UI)

#### Implementing routing

Here's how to implement routing, on a per-component basis. Do this for each component that participates in routing.
