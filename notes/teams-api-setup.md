## Teams API

The Teams API is a fully-functional web service that can be used during this BTI425 course. 

This course focuses on front-end (client side) development. Often, we will need to interact with a web service. 

The Teams API is that web service. It removes the burden from the BTI425 student of having to create both a *front-end app* and a *back-end web service*. 

You're welcome. 

Enjoy!

### Get the Teams API

The course's code examples repository is here:

[https://github.com/sictweb/bti425](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425)

You can also get to it by clicking the "Code examples" button on the upper-right area of the page. (Use a modifier key or keys with click to open it in a new tab/window.)

Download a zip of the entire repository.

Study the repository. It has a folder named **Templates_and_solutions**. In that folder, you will find the **teams-api** folder.

### Setup the Teams API

In the **teams-api** folder, the README.md has detailed setup (and usage) instructions. 

That will be your important task for today, in this first class session. If you don't get it all done today, then continue it outside of class.
