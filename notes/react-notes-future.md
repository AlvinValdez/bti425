### State

[Where to initialize state in React](https://daveceddia.com/where-initialize-state-react/)

<br>

### Things to know, beginners

Create a new project with the `create-react-app` script.  

Dev env should include:
* Browser to run your app
* Editor
* Two terminal windows
  * One to do file system operations and
  * The other to run the app (`npm start`)

Minimal new React app has these assets:
* `public/index.html` 
* `src/index.js`
* `src/App.js`

<br>

#### Info about `public/index.html`  

Its purpose is to be the app's public start resource.  
For simple apps, we do not have to edit this file.  
Any kind of web server can deliver this resource.  
Includes an empty `div` element, named "root".  
The `div` will receive the app-generated content.  

```jsx
<div id="root"></div>
```

<br>

#### Info about `src/index.js`

Its purpose is to be the app's code entry point.  
For simple apps, we do not have to edit this file.  
It adds an "App" component to the `div` element from above:  

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

<br>

#### Info about `src/App.js`

Its purpose is to define the app's first component class.  
It is generated by the `create-react-app` script.  

<br>

#### Run the app

To run the app, `npm start`.  
The `start` script will build and package your app.  
Then deliver it to a new browser window/tab.

### Validation

Did not cover any of this in 2018 and 2019.
