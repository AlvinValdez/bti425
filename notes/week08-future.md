## BTI425 Week 8 Notes

Recall, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

During your work on Assignment 3, you had a very brief introduction to the essential *Angular routing* topics. Today, we will turn our full attention to Routing in Angular, specifically: 

* Examining the supporting documentation on Angular Routing
* How to configure / use routing
* Adding routing to an existing application
* Planning components / routes
* Configuring special components / routes (e.g. "Page not found").
