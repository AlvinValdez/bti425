## BTI425 Week 11 Notes

So far, we've been working with our web applications in a local environment. We have relied on the frameworks (the integrated "development servers" included in React and Angular) to execute our code on localhost. However, sooner or later we will have to build and publish these applications so that they are available for the public to use. This week, we will see how we can achieve this using our experience with Node.js and Express.

**Test 5 is on Tuesday, April 3**

The test questions are based on the Angular topics and learning experience, during last week *and* this week. That includes some content from the current assignment too.
