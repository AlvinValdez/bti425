## BTI425 Week 4 Notes

The theme for the next two weeks is to introduce you to learning and using **React**, a JavaScript library from Facebook, for building user interfaces. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).

**Topics:**

This week:
* Introduction to React
* Getting started by creating a simple application
* More about components (as an architectural design)

Next week:
* Routing
* Communicating with our Teams API
* Creating a simple single-page app (SPA) with multiple routes

<br>

### Topic sequence

This week, we introduce a new way (for our students) to think about building an web app: Component-based architecture. 

To get started, read this [introduction to React](react-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content. 

Next, follow along as you [get started with React](react-get-started). Learn how to install the developer bits, and generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its component-based architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](react-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials.
