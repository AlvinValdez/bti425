## BTI425 Week 13 Notes

We're at the end of the course; this is the last week of classes. We continue to discuss and implement some *security topics* in our apps.

**Test 6 is on Tuesday, April 17**

The test questions are based on the Angular topics and learning experience, during last week *and* this week. That includes some content from the current assignment too.
