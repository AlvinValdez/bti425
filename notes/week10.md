## BTI425 Week 10 Notes

> This document is being edited.  
> This notice will be removed when the edits are complete.  

The theme for this week is to work with Angular forms. An app that interacts with users must use forms efficiently and effectively. With this objective, we focus on:

* Refreshing our knowledge of HTML Form concepts and techniques
* Configuring an Angular app to use forms

We will then discuss how to bind data (using two-way binding) and form submission. 

Finally, we will illustrate some of the special CSS classes Angular uses to automatically track the state of elements, e.g. untouched, dirty, invalid, etc. We follow that with a brief discussion on form validation in Angular.

## WEB422 Week 10 Notes

The theme for this week is to work with Angular forms. An app that interacts with users must use forms efficiently and effectively.  To this end, we focus on:

* Refreshing your memory by showing a simple and standard HTML Form.
* Followed by configuring an Angular app to use HTML forms

We will then discuss how to “bind”  data (using “two-way” binding) and “submit” the form

Finally, we will illustrate some of the special CSS classes Angular uses to automatically track the “state” of elements, ie: “untouched”, “dirty”, “invalid”, etc, followed by a quick discussion on Form Validation in Angular
