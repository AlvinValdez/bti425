## Client apps that use a web API

This brief document has information about client apps that use a web API. 

There are two clients apps, and both are configured as simple HTML5 apps (HTML, JavaScript, DOM):
1. An app that uses the legacy XMLHttpRequest ojbect
2. Another that uses the new Fetch API 

Get the apps from [the course's code example repository](https://github.com/sictweb/bti425).

Open each app's `index.html` in a browser, and interact.  
Your device must have an internet connection when using the apps.
