## BTI425 Week 12 Notes

As we near the end of the course, we will discuss and implement some *security topics* in our apps.

**Complete the checklist on Thursday, April 12**

Bring your Assignment 5 project to the Thursday class session. You will review your work, and then complete and submit a checklist. 

> Notice: Next Thursday, April 19, will be the *last day* to complete the checklists for Assignments 1 through 5.  
> Remember, to receive a grade for an assignment, you must complete and submit the paper checklists that are only available in-class during the Thursday class sessions.
