To preview the contents, we will do a few tasks:

* Implement a "login" user interface

* This includes some work in the data manager service

* After a successful login, save the token in the app's memory

* Implement the code to handle the token as part of a request to a web service

* Implement the code to protect a route (in the Angular app)

( more to come )
