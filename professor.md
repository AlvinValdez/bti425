### Get help with course work

I am obviously available during our course time slots on Tuesday and Thursday.

During the Tuesday class, I will have limited free time.

During the Thursday class, I will have substantial free time. Thursdays will be the best day to get one-on-one help from me.

I plan to have drop-in help time on Tuesday from 2:45pm to 3:45pm, in my office (DB2081).

And also on Wednesday from 11:30am to 12:30pm.

While I will be somewhat available by email at other times, I will prefer to be available for help during the days and times discussed above. I will not commit to being available 24×7.

This may become important to you if you are facing a Sunday 6:00pm deadline for the assignment submission, and you discover that you want my help on Saturday or Sunday. I will almost certainly not be available. Therefore, you will be on your own, but you still must practice academic honesty. If you anticipate that this practice will be a problem for you, then set your own assignment due date deadline to better match my availability – for example, the Thursday or Friday just before the Sunday deadline.
