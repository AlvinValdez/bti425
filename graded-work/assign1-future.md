### Doing the work

### Testing your work

For this assignment, there is no required external testing capability. Therefore, rely on your browser tools for this step. 

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

You must comply with the College’s academic honesty policy. Although you may interact and collaborate with others, you must submit your own work.

When you are ready to submit your work, you will copy some of the code in your project to plain text files, so that the My.Seneca/Blackboard “SafeAssign” tool can do its job. The next section will tell you which files to copy.

SafeAssign compares your work with that of other current and past students, and with existing works on the web. It uses techniques that are difficult to defeat. The overall goal is to identify copied work.

### Submitting your work

> This procedure will be modified.  
> We need both the Node+Express web service and the React web app.  

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

1. Locate the folder that holds your project files. 

2. Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

3. Inside that folder, remove (delete) the `node_modules` folder. Your professor does NOT need that folder. 

4. Still in that folder, add a new folder named "MyCode". Copy these source code files to the "MyCode" folder:  
**TBA**  
**TBA**  
For each of these files, change the file name extension to "txt".

4. Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be about 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.

5. Login to My.Seneca. Open the course area. Click the “Assignments” link on the left-side navigator. Follow the link for this assignment. Submit/upload your zip file. The page will accept three submissions, so if you upload, then decide to fix something and upload again, you can do so.
