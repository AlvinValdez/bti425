**Reminder about how-to instructions and guidance**

As first described in the previous assignment specifications, the how-to instructions in this assignment, and in future assignments, will be less detailed, with less guidance.  

<br> 

### Specifications overview and work plan

Here's a brief list of specifications that you must implement:

* TBA

More details are provided below, in the section titled **"Doing the work"**.

During the Thursday classes/sessions, your professor will help you *get started* and *make progress* on the assignment. 

<br>

### Getting started

TBA

<br>

**Starting work on the assignment**

Open a terminal window, and navigate to a suitable file system location. We will use the Angular CLI program to create the folder and its generated code for the project:

```
ng new assignment4 --routing -st -sg
```

After the generation completes, verify that it runs. Prepare the rest of your dev environment:
* Probably use another terminal window (so you can run code-generation commands)
* Probably use one or two Finder windows/tabs (for graphical navigation and Quick Look viewing)
* Code editor 
* Browser developer tools (at a minimum, you'll probably be using the element inspector, and the JavaScript console)

### Testing your work

For this assignment, there is no external testing capability that can be used. 

Therefore, rely on your browser tools for this step. Soon, your professor will help you learn how to use the debugger.

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

You must comply with the College’s academic honesty policy.

Although you may interact and collaborate with others, you must submit your own work.

<br> 

### Submitting your work

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

1. Locate the folder that holds your project files. 

2. Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

3. Inside that folder, remove (delete) the `node_modules` folder. Your professor does NOT need that folder. 

4. Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be less than 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.

5. Login to My.Seneca. Open the course area. Click the “Assignments” link on the left-side navigator. Follow the link for this assignment. Submit/upload your zip file. The page will accept three submissions, so if you upload, then decide to fix something and upload again, you can do so.
