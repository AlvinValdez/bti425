### Submitting your work

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

1. Locate the folder that holds your project files. 

2. Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

3. Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be less than 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.
