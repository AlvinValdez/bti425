### Due Date

Sunday, March 11, 2018, at 6:00pm ET

Grade value: 10% of your final course grade

*If you wish to submit the assignment before the due date and time, you can do that.*

<br>

### Introduction to the problem to be solved

Tentative:
* Components, many
* Data, display and edit (centralized data/state storage, simple?) 
* Master > detail and data flow among components
* Some introductory coverage of routing 
* Maybe re-do some of the things we did in A1 and A2 but with Angular? 

( more to come )

<br> 

### Specifications overview and work plan

Here's a brief list of specifications that you must implement:

* Follow best practices, guidance, and recommendations

( more to come )

More details are provided below, in the section titled **"Doing the work"**.

During the Thursday classes/sessions, your professor will help you *get started* and *make progress* on the assignment. 

<br>

### Getting started

Open a terminal window, and navigate to a suitable file system location. We will use the Angular CLI program to create the folder and its generated code:

```
ng new assignment3 --routing -st
```

After it completes, verify that it runs, by using the `ng serve --open` command; it should build/compile, open a browser window/tab, and show the "welcome" view. At this point, you can probably leave it running, because your changes will be processed as you make them. 

Prepare the rest of your dev environment:
* Probably another terminal window
* Probably one or two Finder windows/tabs
* Code editor
* Browser developer tools (at a minimum, you'll probably be using the element inspector, and the JavaScript console)

<br>

#### Add links to Bootstrap CSS and plugins

Edit `src/index.html`:
1. Add the Bootstrap CSS library link element (CDN version) to the `<head>` element
2. Add the jQuery and Bootstrap JavaScript script elements to the *end* of the `<body>` element

### Testing your work

For this assignment, there is no external testing capability that can be used. 

Therefore, rely on your browser tools for this step. Soon, your professor will help you learn how to use the debugger.

<br>

### Reminder about academic honesty

You must comply with the College’s academic honesty policy.

Although you may interact and collaborate with others, you must submit your own work.

<br> 

### Submitting your work

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

1. Locate the folder that holds your project files. 

2. Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

3. Inside that folder, remove (delete) the `node_modules` folder. Your professor does NOT need that folder. 

4. Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be less than 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.

5. Login to My.Seneca. Open the course area. Click the “Assignments” link on the left-side navigator. Follow the link for this assignment. Submit/upload your zip file. The page will accept three submissions, so if you upload, then decide to fix something and upload again, you can do so.
