### Submitting your work

Here’s how to submit your work, before the due date and time:

1. Locate the folder that holds your project files. 

2. Make a copy of the folder. (You will be uploading a zipped version of the copy.)

3. **TBA** Remove the “node_modules” folder from the copied folder.

4. Compress/zip the copied folder. The zip file SHOULD be less than 1MB in size. If it isn’t, you haven’t followed the instructions properly.

5. Login to My.Seneca. Open the course area. Click the “Assignments” link on the left-side navigator. Follow the link for this assignment. Submit/upload your zip file. The page will accept three submissions, so if you upload, then decide to fix something and upload again, you can do so.
