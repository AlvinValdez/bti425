## Graded work

This page has details about the graded work in BTI425, for the current academic term.

<br>

### Tests

We have planned six (6) tests during the term.

The duration of each test will be 30 to 40 minutes. Each test will be worth 10% of your final course grade. All tests will be hand-written, and will happen sometime during the class timeslot. The total value of all tests will be 50%.

If you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. However, absence due to illness or other reasons happen occasionally. As a result, you can miss a test, without suffering the loss of grades.

The effect of this policy will be extended to all students. At the end of the course, your lowest test result will be discarded, leaving your best five results.

### Assignments

We have planned six (6) assignments during the term.

The assignments have a two-week lifetime. Most are independent of each other. 

During the term, one (1) *late* assignment will be accepted within four (4) days of its due date. 

Otherwise, if you do not submit an assignment by the due date, its grade is zero, and there is no opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.

Each assignment will be worth 10% of your final course grade. The total value of all assignments will be 50%. At the end of the course, the lowest assignment result will be discarded, leaving your best five results.

### Frequently-asked questions

The following are frequently-asked questions about course policies and grading. 

<br>

**Make-up (replacement) tests? No.**

We don't do make-up or replacement tests, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* Tests are designed, in part, to encourage you to prepare for class *before* you walk into the room. Doing a test after the class has happened just doesn't make sense.

* Your lowest test result is discarded before your final grade is calculated, so missing a test does not affect your final grade.

* Test answers are discussed during class, so doing a test after class is pointless.

Therefore, no make-up or replacement tests. 

<br>

**Due date extensions? No.**

As noted above, during the term, one (1) *late* assignment will be accepted within four (4) days of its due date. 

However, as a general rule, we don't do due date extensions for assignments, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* They cause problems for other work that follows an assignment, because it leaves less time to complete the next piece of work.

* They take your attention away from new topics in this course. You're less receptive, or will ignore, new topics that follow the ones that are practiced on the assignment.

* A due date extension is disrespectful to other students in the course, because it tells them that the work they did to meet the due date doesn't have value.

* Finally a due date extension is disrespectful to other professors and their courses, because it takes your attention away from their coursework while you are working on late work.

Therefore, no due date extensions.
