## Policies and Standards

<br>

### Contacting Faculty

It is up to the individual professor to inform you about their availability outside of class. If you email your professor for help, you can expect a response within a day.

If you need help debugging your code, please make an appointment with your professor during office hours (student help time) so that you can work through the solution together.

<br>

### Lectures & Student Conduct

* Be on time for class

* Respect other students

* Lectures will explain and demonstrate the skills and concepts you need to complete the assignments.

* Frequent absence will be noted. You are responsible on all tests and labs for any material covered or assigned in class. People who do not come to class generally have significant problems completing their assignments and traditionally do not perform well on their tests.

* Classes will start on time and late arrivals must not disturb the class. Enter quietly and take a seat. Do not disturb the class by asking questions about what took place before your arrival.

* If you missed a class, please ask a colleague, not the instructor, about what was covered. An email to an instructor about what was covered in class will get a response along the lines of “that was covered in class”.

* Please ensure that you follow <a href="https://ict.senecacollege.ca/students/academic-honesty-policy">Seneca College Academic Honesty Policy</a> when you do your work. Violations of the Academic Honesty Policy will not be tolerated.

### Tests

We have planned approximately six (6) tests during the term.

The duration of each test will range from 30 to 40 minutes. Each test will be worth 10% of your final course grade. All tests will be hand-written, and will happen sometime during the class timeslot. The total value of all tests will be 50%.

If you miss a test, there is no opportunity to do a replacement test. However, absence due to illness or other reasons happen occasionally. As a result, you can miss one (1) test without suffering the loss of grades.

The effect of this policy will be extended to all students. At the end of the course, your lowest test result will be discarded, leaving your best five results.

<br>

### Assignments

We have planned six (6) assignments during the term.

The assignments have a two-week lifetime. Most are independent of each other. 

During the term, one (1) *late* assignment will be accepted within four (4) days of its due date. 

Otherwise, if you do not submit an assignment by the due date, its grade is *zero*, and there is no opportunity to earn marks for a late submission.

Each assignment will be worth 10% of your final course grade. The total value of all assignments will be 50%. At the end of the course, the lowest assignment result will be discarded, leaving your best five results.
